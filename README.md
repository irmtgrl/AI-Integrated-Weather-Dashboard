# AI Integrated Weather Dashboard
We live in an era where everything is smarter and integrated with the latest technologies. I wanted to bring the same approach to this weather application. When checking the weather, it can be difficult to consider every factor to decide what to wear or which places to visit. This app uses AI to evaluate weather data and provide personalized recommendations.

### Steps:
<ul>
<li>Enter a city name and hit enter.</li>
<li>Hover over the greetings section to see detailed AI recommendations of what to wear and where to visit in that location, considering the weather conditions.</li>
<li>Click change location button on top right to change the location.</li>
</ul>
